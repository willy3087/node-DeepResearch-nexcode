For instance, here is a simplified version of the `UrlField`:\n\n```\n// in src/MyUrlField.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst MyUrlField = ({ record = {}, source }) =>\n    <a href={record[source]}>\n        {record[source]}\n    </a>;\n\nexport default MyUrlField;\n```\n\nYou can use this component in `<UserList>`, instead of react-admin’s `<UrlField>` component, and it will work just the same.\n\n```\n// in src/users.js\nimport React from 'react';\n-import { List, Datagrid, TextField, EmailField, UrlField } from 'react-admin';\n+import { List, Datagrid, TextField, EmailField } from 'react-admin';\n+import MyUrlField from './MyUrlField';\n\nexport const UserList = props => (\n    <List {...props}>\n        <Datagrid rowClick=\"edit\">\n            <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            <TextField source=\"name\" />\n            <EmailField source=\"email\" />\n            <TextField source=\"phone\" />\n-           <UrlField source=\"website\" />\n+           <MyUrlField source=\"website\" />\n            <TextField source=\"company.name\" />\n        </Datagrid>\n    </List>\n);\n```\n\nYes, you can replace any of react-admin’s components with your own! That means react-admin never blocks you: if one react-admin component doesn’t perfectly suit your needs, you can easily swap it with your own version.\n\nCustomizing Styles\n------------------\n\nThe `MyUrlField` component is a perfect opportunity to illustrate how to customize styles. React-admin relies on material-ui, a set of React components modeled after Google’s Material Design UI Guidelines. Material-ui uses JSS, a CSS-in-JS solution, for styling components. Let’s take advantage of the capabilities of JSS to remove the underline from the link and add an icon:\n\n```\n// in src/MyUrlField.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport LaunchIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Launch';\n\nconst styles = {\n    link: {\n        textDecoration: 'none',\n    },\n    icon: {\n        width: '0.5em',\n        paddingLeft: 2,\n    },\n};\n\nconst MyUrlField = ({ record = {}, source, classes }) =>\n    <a href={record[source]} className={classes.link}>\n        {record[source]}\n        <LaunchIcon className={classes.icon} />\n    </a>;\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(MyUrlField);\n```\n\nIn JSS, you define styles as a JavaScript object, using the JS variants of the CSS property names (e.g. `textDecoration` instead of `text-decoration`). To pass these styles to the component, wrap it inside a call to `withStyles(styles)`. JSS will create new class names for these styles, insert them (once) in the HTML document, and pass the new class names as a new `classes` property. Then, use these names in a `className` prop, as you would with a regular CSS class.\n\n**Tip**: There is much more to JSS than what this tutorial covers. Read the material-ui documentation to learn more about theming, vendor prefixes, responsive utili\n\n</snippet-1>\n\n<snippet-2>\n\nmore `<Resource>` child components. Each resource maps a name to an endpoint in the API. Edit the `App.js` file to add a resource named `users`:\n\n```\n// in src/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\n-import { Admin } from 'react-admin';\n+import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from 'react-admin';\nimport jsonServerProvider from 'ra-data-json-server';\n\nconst dataProvider = jsonServerProvider('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com');\n-const App = () => <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider} />;\n+const App = () => (\n+    <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>\n+        <Resource name=\"users\" list={ListGuesser} />\n+    </Admin>\n+);\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThe line `<Resource name=\"users\" />` informs react-admin to fetch the “users” records from the http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users URL. `<Resource>` also defines the React components to use for each CRUD operation (`list`, `create`, `edit`, and `show`).\n\nThe `list={ListGuesser}` prop means that react-admin should use the `<ListGuesser>` component to display the list of posts. This component _guesses_ the format to use for the columns of the list based on the data fetched from the API:\n\nIf you look at the network tab in the browser developer tools, you’ll notice that the application fetched the `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` URL, then used the results to build the datagrid. That’s basically how react-admin works.\n\nThe list is already functional: you can reorder it by clicking on column headers, or change pages by using the bottom pagination controls. The `ra-data-json-server` data provider translates these actions to a query string that JSONPlaceholder understands.\n\nSelecting Columns\n-----------------\n\nThe `<ListGuesser>` component is not meant to be used in production - it’s just a way to quicky bootstrap an admin. That means you’ll have to replace the `ListGuesser` component in the `users` resource by a custom React component. Fortunately, `ListGuesser` dumps the code of the list it has guessed to the console:\n\nLet’s copy this code, and create a new `UserList` component, in a new file named `users.js`:\n\n```\n// in src/users.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { List, Datagrid, TextField, EmailField } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport const UserList = props => (\n    <List {...props}>\n        <Datagrid rowClick=\"edit\">\n            <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            <TextField source=\"name\" />\n            <TextField source=\"username\" />\n            <EmailField source=\"email\" />\n            <TextField source=\"address.street\" />\n            <TextField source=\"phone\" />\n            <TextField source=\"website\" />\n            <TextField source=\"company.name\" />\n        </Datagrid>\n    </List>\n);\n```\n\nThen, edit the `App.js` file to use this new component instead of `ListGuesser`:\n\n```\n// in src/App.js\n-import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from 'react-admin';\n+import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';\n+import { UserList } from './users';\n\nconst App = () => (\n    <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>\n\n</snippet-2>\n\n<snippet-3>\n\n-       <Resource name=\"users\" list={ListGuesser} />\n+       <Resource name=\"users\" list={UserList} />\n    </Admin>\n);\n```\n\nThere is no visible change in the browser - except now, the app uses a component that you can customize.\n\nThe main component of the users list is a `<List>` component, responsible for grabbing the information from the API, displaying the page title, and handling pagination. This list then delegates the display of the actual list of users to its child. In this case, that’s a `<Datagrid>` component, which renders a table with one row for each record. The datagrid uses its child components (here, a list of `<TextField>` and `<EmailField>`) to determine the columns to render. Each Field component maps a different field in the API response, specified by the `source` prop.\n\nThe `ListGuesser` created one column for every field in the response. That’s a bit too much of a usable grid, so let’s remove a couple `<TextField>` from the datagrid and see the effect:\n\n```\n// in src/users.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { List, Datagrid, TextField, EmailField } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport const UserList = props => (\n    <List {...props}>\n        <Datagrid rowClick=\"edit\">\n            <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            <TextField source=\"name\" />\n-           <TextField source=\"username\" />\n            <EmailField source=\"email\" />\n-           <TextField source=\"address.street\" />\n            <TextField source=\"phone\" />\n            <TextField source=\"website\" />\n            <TextField source=\"company.name\" />\n        </Datagrid>\n    </List>\n);\n```\n\nWhat you’ve just done reflects the early stages of development with react-admin: let the guesser do the job, select only the fields you want, and start customizing types.\n\nUsing Field Types\n-----------------\n\nYou’ve just met the `<TextField>` and the `<EmailField>` components. React-admin provides more Field components, mapping various data types: number, date, image, HTML, array, reference, etc.\n\nFor instance, the `website` field looks like an URL. Instead of displaying it as text, why not display it using a clickable link? That’s exactly what the `<UrlField>` does:\n\n```\n// in src/users.js\nimport React from 'react';\n-import { List, Datagrid, TextField, EmailField } from 'react-admin';\n+import { List, Datagrid, TextField, EmailField, UrlField } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport const UserList = props => (\n    <List {...props}>\n        <Datagrid rowClick=\"edit\">\n            <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            <TextField source=\"name\" />\n            <EmailField source=\"email\" />\n            <TextField source=\"phone\" />\n-           <TextField source=\"website\" />\n+           <UrlField source=\"website\" />\n            <TextField source=\"company.name\" />\n        </Datagrid>\n    </List>\n);\n```\n\nIn react-admin, fields are simple React components. At runtime, they receive the `record` fetched from the API (e.g. `{ \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Ervin Howell\", \"website\": \"anastasia.net\", ... }`), and the `source` fie\n\n</snippet-3>\n\n<snippet-4>\n\nt recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto\",\n    \"userId\": 1\n}\n```\n\nReact-admin knows how to take advantage of these foreign keys to fetch references. Let’s see how the `ListGuesser` manages them by creating a new `<Resource>` for the `/posts` API endpoint:\n\n```\n// in src/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\n-import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';\n+import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from 'react-admin';\nimport jsonServerProvider from 'ra-data-json-server';\nimport { UserList } from './users';\n\nconst App = () => (\n    <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>\n+       <Resource name=\"posts\" list={ListGuesser} />\n        <Resource name=\"users\" list={UserList} />\n    </Admin>\n);\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThe `ListGuesser` suggests using a `<ReferenceField>` for the `userId` field. Let’s play with this new field by creating the `PostList` component based on the code dumped by the guesser:\n\n```\n// in src/posts.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { List, Datagrid, TextField, ReferenceField } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport const PostList = props => (\n    <List {...props}>\n        <Datagrid rowClick=\"edit\">\n            <ReferenceField source=\"userId\" reference=\"users\">\n                <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            </ReferenceField>\n            <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            <TextField source=\"title\" />\n            <TextField source=\"body\" />\n        </Datagrid>\n    </List>\n);\n```\n\n```\n// in src/App.js\n-import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from 'react-admin';\n+import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';\n+import { PostList } from './posts';\nimport { UserList } from './users';\n\nconst App = () => (\n    <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>\n-       <Resource name=\"posts\" list={ListGuesser} />\n+       <Resource name=\"posts\" list={PostList} />\n        <Resource name=\"users\" list={UserList} />\n    </Admin>\n);\n```\n\nWhen displaying the posts list, the app displays the `id` of the post author as a `<TextField>`. This `id` field doesn’t mean much, let’s use the user `name` instead:\n\n```\n// in src/posts.js\nexport const PostList = props => (\n    <List {...props}>\n        <Datagrid rowClick=\"edit\">\n            <ReferenceField source=\"userId\" reference=\"users\">\n-               <TextField source=\"id\" />\n+               <TextField source=\"name\" />\n            </ReferenceField>\n            <TextField source=\"id\" />\n            <TextField source=\"title\" />\n            <TextField source=\"body\" />\n        </Datagrid>\n    </List>\n);\n```\n\nThe post list now displays the user names on each line.\n\n**Tip**: The `<ReferenceField>` component alone doesn’t display anything. It just fetches the reference data, and passes it as a `record` to its child component (a `<TextField>` in our case). Just like the `<List>` component, all `<Reference>` components are only responsible for fetching and preparing data, and delegate rendering to their children.\n\n**Tip**: Look at the network\n\n</snippet-4>\n\n<snippet-5>\n\nose ; let’s use the `<EditGuesser>` to help bootstrap it.\n\n```\n// in src/App.js\n-import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';\n+import { Admin, Resource, EditGuesser } from 'react-admin';\nimport { PostList } from './posts';\nimport { UserList } from './users';\n\nconst App = () => (\n    <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>\n-       <Resource name=\"posts\" list={PostList} />\n+       <Resource name=\"posts\" list={PostList} edit={EditGuesser} />\n        <Resource name=\"users\" list={UserList} />\n    </Admin>\n);\n```\n\nUsers can display the edit page just by clicking on the Edit button. The form rendered is already functional; it issues `PUT` requests to the REST API upon submission.\n\nCopy the `PostEdit` code dumped by the guesser in the console to the `posts.js` file so that you can customize the view. Don’t forget to `import` the new components from react-admin.\n\nYou can now adjust the `PostEdit` component to disable the edition of the primary key (`id`), place it first, use the user `name` instead of the user `id` in the reference, and use a longer text input for the `body` field, as follows:\n\n```\n// in src/posts.js\nexport const PostEdit = props => (\n    <Edit {...props}>\n        <SimpleForm>\n+           <DisabledInput source=\"id\" />\n            <ReferenceInput source=\"userId\" reference=\"users\">\n-               <SelectInput optionText=\"id\" />\n+               <SelectInput optionText=\"name\" />\n            </ReferenceInput>\n-           <TextInput source=\"id\" />\n            <TextInput source=\"title\" />\n-           <TextInput source=\"body\" />\n+           <LongTextInput source=\"body\" />\n        </SimpleForm>\n    </Edit>\n);\n```\n\nIf you’ve understood the `<List>` component, the `<Edit>` component will be no surprise. It’s responsible for fetching the record, and displaying the page title. It passes the record down to the `<SimpleForm>` component, which is responsible for the form layout, default values, and validation. Just like `<Datagrid>`, `<SimpleForm>` uses its children to determine the form inputs to display. It expects _input components_ as children. `<DisabledInput>`, `<TextInput>`, `<ReferenceInput>`, and `<SelectInput>` are such inputs.\n\nThe `<ReferenceInput>` takes the same props as the `<ReferenceField>` (used earlier in the `PostList` page). `<ReferenceInput>` uses these props to fetch the API for possible references related to the current record (in this case, possible `users` for the current `post`). It then passes these possible references to the child component (`<SelectInput>`), which is responsible for displaying them (via their `name` in that case), and letting the user select one. `<SelectInput>` renders as a `<select>` tag in HTML.\n\nBefore you can use that custom component in the `App.js`, copy the `PostEdit` component into a `PostCreate`, and replace `Edit` by `Create`:\n\n```\n// in src/posts.js\nexport const PostCreate = props => (\n    <Create {...props}>\n        <SimpleForm>\n            <ReferenceInput source=\"userId\" reference=\"users\">\n     \n\n</snippet-5> // Adiciona a resposta do conhecimento"

It took a handful of days of returning to it to continue following along, but during this tutorial I went from error 404: React Knowledge Not Found, to a full understanding of it. Moreso, I've coded since I was young but JavaScript has never made complete sense to me. Your specific articulation and instruction was immensely helpful and I feel like I have a much better understanding of JS now as well! If that wasn't enough, I also finally understand how different files import/export to each other which makes me so much more confident in using new packages and making my own components. I appreciate this video & you so much! Now that I have it completed I'll be experimenting with it before hopping into another tutorial, but can't wait for the next one. \n\nShow less Read more\n\nLike\n\n55\n\nDislike\n\nReply\n\n2 replies\n\n2 replies\n\n### @thedexterityproject2431\n\n1 year ago\n\nThis is the best teaching style i have found on the internet. i have even used mulitple payed learning platforms and they still miss big steps and the small things that are easy to over looked. well done @EdRoh this has been a great help in my leaning and career keep up the good work.\n\nShow less Read more\n\nLike\n\n3\n\nDislike\n\nReply\n\n### @TheSonicPT\n\n2 years ago\n\nHi Ed, great tutorial this is really clear and helpful.  I spotted a slight continuity/editing order problem in the \"Router Setup\" chapter.

It is quite packed for almost 6 hours yet you retained the energy with some cuts while delivering what the project required. It is definitely not for the beginners eventhough they could just follow step by step and reach the final result but sheer amount of concepts and opinionated nature of a framework included therein makes it look more complex then it actually is in humble beginnings. The way you set things up in advance (providers) are elegant yet once again requires a good command of javascript and react as you initially mentioned.\n\nShow less Read more\n\nLike\n\n1\n\nDislike\n\nReply\n\n1 reply\n\n1 reply\n\n### @pemawangchuk2024\n\n1 year ago\n\nThank You Adrian for making such course free.

Then, when you fixed \"unnassigned\"(sp) like that without cmd+f, I felt MUCH smarter for about 40 seconds... ... aaaaand back to feeling real dumb again! But really, you're teaching me so much. Every time I go through your tutorials I'm so much better at React. I think I'll build my own dashboard later and reference your video! Phenomenal. I have no idea how much prep this must take but the fact that it is FREE is INSANE. This could be a full $100 course on udemy easily. I would love to see more on GraphQL and NestJS from you.

Please reflect\n\n<question>\nache pra mim libs em react fácil de implementar no meu projeto react.js, quero fazer o dash\n</question>\n\n<answer>\nPara criar um dashboard em React.js de forma fácil, algumas bibliotecas se destacam pela facilidade de uso e implementação:\n\n*   **Material UI (MUI):** Uma das bibliotecas de componentes React mais populares, oferece uma vasta gama de componentes pré-estilizados e personalizáveis, incluindo templates de dashboard gratuitos [^1]. É excelente para prototipagem rápida e possui uma comunidade ativa, o que facilita encontrar soluções e tutoriais.\n\n*   **React-Admin:** Framework para construir interfaces de administração B2B em React, ideal para criar dashboards complexos rapidamente com base em APIs REST/GraphQL [^2]. Possui componentes e funcionalidades como DataGrid, formulários e autenticação.\n\n*   **Shadcn UI:** Uma biblioteca de componentes React construída sobre Radix UI e Tailwind CSS, conhecida pela sua acessibilidade e customização. Embora não seja um pacote completo de dashboard, oferece os blocos de construção necessários para criar interfaces modernas e responsivas [^3].\n\n*   **CoreUI:** Oferece componentes de UI React para construir dashboards profissionais, totalmente responsivos e altamente personalizáveis [^4]. Possui templates e componentes que aceleram o desenvolvimento.\n\n*   **TailGrids:** Uma biblioteca de componentes React com mais de 600 componentes fáceis de usar e personalizáveis, ideal para construir dashboards modernos e responsivos [^5].\n\nAlém dessas bibliotecas, vale a pena considerar:\n\n*   **Refine:** Uma biblioteca abrangente e de código aberto para desenvolver dashboards React orientados a dados [^6].\n*   **Ant Design (AntD):** Outra biblioteca popular com uma vasta coleção de componentes e templates de dashboard.\n\nAo escolher uma biblioteca, considere os seguintes fatores:\n\n*   **Facilidade de uso:** A biblioteca deve ser fácil de aprender e usar, com boa documentação e exemplos.\n*   **Personalização:** A capacidade de personalizar os componentes para corresponder ao design do seu projeto.\n*   **Comunidade:** Uma comunidade ativa significa mais recursos, suporte e atualizações.\n*   **Componentes:** A variedade de componentes oferecidos e se eles atendem às suas necessidades.\n\nPara começar, você pode seguir tutoriais e exemplos online, como os encontrados no YouTube [^7] e em artigos [^8], que mostram como construir dashboards React do zero usando diferentes bibliotecas e ferramentas.\n</answer>"

    "content": "A resposta fornece uma lista de bibliotecas React úteis para criar dashboards, mas carece de detalhes comparativos concretos. Por exemplo, não há uma análise direta sobre qual biblioteca é mais fácil de implementar para um iniciante ou qual oferece maior flexibilidade de personalização. Também faltam exemplos específicos de componentes de dashboard e links diretos para tutoriais que facilitem a implementação imediata no projeto do usuário.\n\nNo primeiro passo, fiz uma busca geral por bibliotecas React para dashboards, usando termos como 'React Dashboard Komponenten Vergleich' e 'React admin dashboard tutorial'. Depois, já fui direto para a resposta, listando algumas bibliotecas populares e dando algumas dicas gerais. Mas, pelo visto, faltou um 'algo a mais' na análise.\n\nAcho que me precipitei em responder logo após a busca inicial. Deveria ter aprofundado a pesquisa para comparar as bibliotecas de forma mais concreta, com exemplos práticos e links úteis para o usuário começar a implementar o dashboard rapidinho.\n\nNa próxima, vou focar em detalhar as vantagens e desvantagens de cada biblioteca, com exemplos de código e links para tutoriais específicos, pra facilitar a vida do usuário e mostrar qual é a mais 'easy-peasy' pra ele começar.\n // Adiciona a resposta do conhecimento"
